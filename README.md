# Electricity Load and Weather Analysis in Taiwan

This repository contains the code and data used for analyzing the electricity load and weather patterns in Taiwan. The analysis aims to investigate the relationship between electricity load and weather factors, and predict future electricity development in Taiwan.

## Abstract

The abstract provides an overview of the project and its objectives, including the use of a shallow learning model for prediction and the potential implications for energy allocation in Taiwan.

## Introduction

The introduction section introduces the project and outlines the various steps involved, including data preprocessing, time series decomposition, model selection, and prediction.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes electricity load data and weather data for Taiwan from 2017 to 2021. The dataset consists of several variables, including time series data, categorical variables, and numerical variables related to weather and climate factors.

The Holt-Winters method is implemented to forecast electricity load using the train dataset and evaluate its performance against the test dataset.

## Feature Selection

The feature selection section discusses the process of selecting relevant features for the prediction model, including checking for collinearity and performing backward stepwise regression.

## Base Models

Several base models, including AFM, Na√Øve, Drift, and SES, are implemented to establish baseline predictions for electricity load.

## Multiple Linear Regression
A multiple linear regression model is developed using the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method and evaluated based on statistical criteria and prediction accuracy.

## Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm

The Levenberg Marquardt algorithm is applied to fit the data into the selected ARIMA model, and diagnostic tests are conducted to assess the model's performance.


## Diagnostic Analysis

The diagnostic analysis section includes various tests and assessments, such as confidence intervals, zero/pole cancellation, chi-square tests, and analysis of residual variance.

## Deep Learning Model
